/* resultCallback is a generic name for a 
callback function that is used to return 
results from an asynchronous operation. 
Here is an example of how it might be used: */ 

function myAsyncFunction(input, resultCallback) {
  // perform asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const result = input * 2;
    resultCallback(null, result);
  }, 1000);
}

function handleResult(err, result) {
  if (err) {
    // handle error
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    // handle successful return
    console.log(result);
  }
}

myAsyncFunction(10, handleResult);
/* In this example, myAsyncFunction is a function that performs an asynchronous operation using setTimeout. It takes two arguments: an input value and a callback function named resultCallback. Once the asynchronous operation is complete, myAsyncFunction calls resultCallback with the results of the operation as arguments.

The handleResult function is an example of a resultCallback function. It takes two arguments: an error object and the result of the asynchronous operation. If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, it will be passed as the first argument to handleResult. If no error occurs, the first argument will be null and the second argument will contain the result of the operation.

In this example, we call myAsyncFunction with an input value of 10 and pass handleResult as the second argument. After one second, myAsyncFunction calls handleResult with the result of the asynchronous operation (20) as the second argument. */
